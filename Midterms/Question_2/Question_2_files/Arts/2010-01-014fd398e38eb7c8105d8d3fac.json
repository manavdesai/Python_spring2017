{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "The actress Sandra Bullock, who appeared in the hit films \"The Blind Side\" and \"The Proposal,\" has been named the top box-office draw of 2009 in a survey of theater owners and executives, Reuters reported. Ms. Bullock, who appeared in a number of clinkers in recent years and had been absent from screens since 2007, is the first woman to win that distinction since Julia Roberts exactly a decade ago. Johnny Depp was second on the annual list, which seeks to measure both box office success and audience appeal, and was followed by Matt Damon, George Clooney and Robert Downey Jr. Ms. Bullock's two hits, one a romantic comedy and the other a drama, grossed more than $500 million last year; she also starred in and produced \"All About Steve,\" which took in only $34 million in North America and received overwhelmingly negative reviews.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "The actress is the first woman to win that distinction since Julia Roberts exactly a decade ago.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "ArtsBeat", "main": "Sandra Bullock Named Top Box-Office Draw"}, "_id": "4fd398e38eb7c8105d8d3fac", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/sandra-bullock-named-top-box-office-draw/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "ROHTER", "firstname": "Larry"}], "original": "By LARRY ROHTER"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 144, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "The actress is the first woman to win that distinction since Julia Roberts exactly a decade ago.", "pub_date": "2010-01-01T13:06:01Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Arts"}
