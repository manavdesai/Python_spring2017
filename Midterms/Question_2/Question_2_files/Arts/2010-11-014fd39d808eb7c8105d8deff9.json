{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "We are midway through the current season of \"Dexter'', and we can certainly see a glimpse of what is to come: Lumen and Dexter are soulmates, two people whose psychologies have been shaped almost entirely by extreme violence. The final scene with them in Rita's old bathroom perfectly evoked their like-mindedness and their potential for the kind of real connection that Dexter has never experienced. Yet it also revealed his totalizing fear of actually having that kind of bond.Michael C. Hall's performance here was really powerful: his face seemed to quiver and his body to recoil without actually doing so, as Lumen outlined her biography -- her fear of marriage and of stifling convention, her need to breathe and experience thrills in life beyond having the right kind of china. Of course, this terror of dull, suburban normalcy is exactly what keeps Dexter so restive. He saw himself with frightening clarity in Lumen and is clearly afraid of what it might mean that the fates have delivered to him a woman who would not only accept his proclivities but also share them.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "Lumen and Dexter are soulmates, two people whose psychologies have been shaped largely by extreme violence.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "ArtsBeat", "main": "'Dexter' Watch: A Lethal Bond"}, "_id": "4fd39d808eb7c8105d8deff9", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/dexter-watch-a-lethal-bond/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "BELLAFANTE", "firstname": "Ginia"}], "original": "By GINIA BELLAFANTE"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 588, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "Lumen and Dexter are soulmates, two people whose psychologies have been shaped largely by extreme violence.", "pub_date": "2010-11-01T12:44:06Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Arts"}
