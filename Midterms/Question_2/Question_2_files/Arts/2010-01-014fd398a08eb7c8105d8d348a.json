{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "2010 began well for at least one member of the Paris Opera Ballet. At the end of the company's New Year's Eve performance of Rudolf Nureyev's \"Nutcracker,\" the principal dancer Karl Paquette learned that he had been promoted to the exalted status of \"\u00e9toile,\" or star. The title is the only one at the Paris Opera Ballet that is not earned through the grueling annual competition. It is bestowed by the director of the Opera, Nicolas Joel, at the request of the ballet company's director Brigitte Lef\u00e8vre, and it remains elusive for many. Mr. Paquette, 33, who joined the company in 1994, is both a sterling technician and an excellent partner, with an ability to step in to roles at the last minute.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "The title is the only one at the ballet that is not earned through the grueling annual competition.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "ArtsBeat", "main": "Karl Paquette Is Given Star Status at Paris Opera Ballet"}, "_id": "4fd398a08eb7c8105d8d348a", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/karl-paquette-is-given-star-status-at-paris-opera-ballet/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "SULCAS", "firstname": "Roslyn"}], "original": "By ROSLYN SULCAS"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 123, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "The title is the only one at the ballet that is not earned through the grueling annual competition.", "pub_date": "2010-01-01T20:01:25Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Arts"}
