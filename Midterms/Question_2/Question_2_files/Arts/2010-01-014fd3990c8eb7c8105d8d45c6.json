The museum, housed in the Luxembourg Palace, has drawn more than 5.5 million visitors since its administration was turned over to a private company in 2000, including shows focusing on Modigliani, Botticelli and the holdings of the Phillips Collection in Washington. But according to the Paris daily Le Monde, museum administrators and the French Senate, which controls the museum building, have quarreled, and the Senate has decided to reassert its control. As a result, two planned exhibitions, including one on Impressionism, have been canceled and 100 full- and part-time employees are to be laid off.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "The Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris will close when its current exhibition, a display of Tiffany glass works, ends on Jan. 17, the French government has announced.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "ArtsBeat", "main": "Luxembourg Museum to Close"}, "_id": "4fd3990c8eb7c8105d8d45c6", "web_url": "http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/luxembourg-museum-to-close/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "ROHTER", "firstname": "Larry"}], "original": "By LARRY ROHTER"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 122, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "The Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris will close when its current exhibition, a display of Tiffany glass works, ends on Jan. 17, the French government has announced.", "pub_date": "2010-01-01T13:19:08Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Arts"}
