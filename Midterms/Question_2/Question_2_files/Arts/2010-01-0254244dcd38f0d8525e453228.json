{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "An announcement this week that Van Morrison, 64, had become a father again was a hoax posted by hackers on his Web site, according to a statement issued on Thursday in Mr. Morrison\u2019s name and reported by Agence France-Presse. The initial announcement on his Web site (vanmorrison.com) said that he was the proud father of a new son, George Ivan Morrison III. It added that the baby was \u201cthe spitting image of his daddy\u201d and a dual citizen of Britain and the United States. On Thursday a statement issued on Mr. Morrison\u2019s behalf by the public relations company Fleishman-Hillard International said that the reports were \u201ccompletely and utterly without foundation,\u201d and that he had asked his management \u201cto carry out an immediate investigation into a hacking attack which took place on my Web site on Dec. 29th last.\u201d The first announcement said the child was born to Mr. Morrison and Gigi Lee, who was identified as his wife and manager. But an executive at Fleishman-Hillard, John Saunders, said in an interview with the Irish state radio network that Mr. Morrison had told him that the story was \u201ccompletely false,\u201d and that he had not heard of Gigi Lee. Mr. Morrison\u2019s statement added, \u201cFor the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity, I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison, with whom I have two wonderful children.\u201d.", "keywords": [], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "An announcement this week that Van Morrison, 64, had become a father again was a hoax posted by hackers on his Web site, according to a statement issued on Thursday in Mr. Morrison\u2019s name and reported by Agence France-Presse.
