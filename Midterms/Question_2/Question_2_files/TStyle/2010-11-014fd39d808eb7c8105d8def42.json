The program is far less interested in myth-telling than in breaking down the gears of Tinseltown's myth machine. \"Unlike a lot of histories that have been made, we're not a series of clips of the highlights of the great movies,\" says Jon Wilkman, the series' director, writer and producer. Instead, he tells The Moment, it's about \"how Hollywood functioned. It's a history of Hollywood power - who had it, how'd they get it, what they did with it and how'd they lose it.\"", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "\"Moguls and Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood,\" Turner Classic Movies' seven-part documentary series, breaks down the gears of Tinseltown's myth machine.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "T Magazine", "main": "300 Years of Movies"}, "_id": "4fd39d808eb7c8105d8def42", "web_url": "http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/300-years-of-movies/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "role": "reported", "lastname": "FISCHER", "firstname": "Jonathan", "rank": 1, "middlename": "L."}], "original": "By JONATHAN L.
