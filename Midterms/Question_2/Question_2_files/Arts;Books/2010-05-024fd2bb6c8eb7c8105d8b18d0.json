These include hundreds of independent book retailers (statistically weighted to represent all such outlets); national, regional and local chains; online and multimedia entertainment retailers; university, gift, supermarket, discount department stores and newsstands. An asterisk (*) indicates that a book\u2019s sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger (\u2020) indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders.
