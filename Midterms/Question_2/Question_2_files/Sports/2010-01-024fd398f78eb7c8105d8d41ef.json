{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "The Papajohns.com Bowl has the misfortune of playing next to the Cotton Bowl, clearly the top bowl game of an otherwise forgettable day of college football. Did I say forgettable? For some of you, perhaps; I'll be trying out the old picture-in-picture feature in order to catch what could be a very competitive game, one that stars two teams with contrasting strengths and weaknesses. The Huskies can score (21st nationally with 32.1 points per game) -- the Gamecocks, yet again, cannot (96th). While South Carolina's defense ranks in the top 25 in the nation, Connecticut's is reliably mediocre. Each team is riding its own sort of momentum: South Carolina is coming off a win over rival Clemson, while Connecticut has weathered the emotions of the passing of one of its teammates and takes a three-game win streak into bowl play.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "The Papajohns.com Bowl features South Carolina's defense, which is in the top 25 in the nation, and Connecticut's, which is reliably mediocre.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "The Quad", "main": "Papajohns.com Bowl: South Carolina (7-5) vs. Connecticut (7-5)"}, "_id": "4fd398f78eb7c8105d8d41ef", "web_url": "http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/02/papajohnscom-bowl-south-carolina-7-5-vs-connecticut-7-5/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "MYERBERG", "firstname": "Paul"}], "original": "By PAUL MYERBERG"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 687, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "The Papajohns.com Bowl features South Carolina's defense, which is in the top 25 in the nation, and Connecticut's, which is reliably mediocre.", "pub_date": "2010-01-02T13:42:27Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Sports"}
