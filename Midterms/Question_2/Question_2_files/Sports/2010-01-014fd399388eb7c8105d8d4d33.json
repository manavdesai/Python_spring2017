{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "For the second time today, the Southeastern Conference will meet the Big Ten. The competition between the two power conferences has been relatively lopsided in recent years, most notably in the national championship game. The general feeling is that teams from the Big Ten lack the team speed to stay with teams from the SEC. To be honest, it's difficult to argue with that stance.
