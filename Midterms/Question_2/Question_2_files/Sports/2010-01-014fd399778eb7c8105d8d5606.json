{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "The B.C.S. begins its controversial season with the Rose Bowl (Game Presented by Citi), which pits the champions of the Big Ten, Ohio State, against Oregon of the Pac-10. For Ohio State, this game presents another shot at redemption. The Buckeyes have become a punchline for bowl season incompetence because of their three consecutive B.C.S. setbacks, including losses to Florida and L.S.U. in consecutive national championship games. For Oregon, the Rose Bowl can serve as another high note in a year to remember. Before we forget, these Ducks experienced what looked to be a monumental defeat in the season opener against Bose State; I can admit I thought Oregon would not recover from that 19-8 loss. Recover it did, and its enters this game with a very good chance at winning the program's first Rose Bowl since 1917.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "The B.C.S. begins with the Rose Bowl, which pits the champion of the Big Ten, Ohio State, against Oregon of the Pac-10.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "The Quad", "main": "Rose Bowl: No. 8 Ohio State (10-2) vs. No. 7 Oregon (10-2)"}, "_id": "4fd399778eb7c8105d8d5606", "web_url": "http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/rose-bowl-no-8-ohio-state-10-2-vs-no-7-oregon-10-2/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "MYERBERG", "firstname": "Paul"}], "original": "By PAUL MYERBERG"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 717, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "The B.C.S. begins with the Rose Bowl, which pits the champion of the Big Ten, Ohio State, against Oregon of the Pac-10.", "pub_date": "2010-01-01T08:00:03Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Sports"}
