{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "After the intensity of the Rose and Sugar bowls, it's nice to wake up Saturday with the International Bowl, which pits two second-tier teams from the Big East and Mid-American Conference. If it's bowl season, we all know where to find South Florida: in a tailspin. Yet again, the Bulls have folded in the second half of the season; after starting 5-0 this fall, U.S.F. has dropped five of seven. This is officially a trend. For Northern Illinois, 2009 served as proof that last season's bowl trip -- which came on the heels of a 2-10 finish in 2007 -- was not a fluke. The Huskies have already made a one-win improvement over last season and have a shot at winning eight games for the first time since 2004.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "South Florida experienced a late-season tailspin, while Northern Illinois is going to consecutive bowl games for the first time.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "The Quad", "main": "International Bowl: South Florida (7-5) vs. Northern Illinois (7-5)"}, "_id": "4fd399558eb7c8105d8d51bc", "web_url": "http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/02/international-bowl-south-florida-7-5-vs-northern-illinois-7-5/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "MYERBERG", "firstname": "Paul"}], "original": "By PAUL MYERBERG"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 633, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "South Florida experienced a late-season tailspin, while Northern Illinois is going to consecutive bowl games for the first time.", "pub_date": "2010-01-02T11:34:57Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Sports"}
