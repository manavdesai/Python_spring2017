{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "If we forget about the controversy surrounding each of these programs over the past 30 days -- Brian Kelly leaving for Notre Dame, Urban Meyer's health scare and ongoing coaching future -- this game is as exciting as any bowl this season. On one hand, you have the Big East champion Bearcats, who sport one of the most prolific, exciting offenses in the country. Cincinnati's rapid ascension from F.B.S. afterthought to Big East power has been one of the best stories of this decade. Florida is running low after a loss to Alabama in the SEC championship, which prevented the Gators from playing for yet another national championship, but the Gators are clearly one of the best teams in the country. Of course, this is the final collegiate game for quarterback Tim Tebow, who we will all miss -- whether you want to admit it or not. It may be difficult for both teams to forget about the off-field news, but if we're lucky, once this game gets underway we will see two of the top teams in the nation.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "There has been plenty of off-the-field news heading into this game, which will mark the end of Tim Tebow's career at Florida.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "The Quad", "main": "Sugar Bowl: No. 3 Cincinnati (12-0) vs. No. 5 Florida (12-1)"}, "_id": "4fd398c98eb7c8105d8d3ae1", "web_url": "http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/sugar-bowl-no-3-cincinnati-12-0-vs-no-5-florida-12-1/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "MYERBERG", "firstname": "Paul"}], "original": "By PAUL MYERBERG"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 829, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "There has been plenty of off-the-field news heading into this game, which will mark the end of Tim Tebow's career at Florida.", "pub_date": "2010-01-01T17:33:42Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Sports"}
