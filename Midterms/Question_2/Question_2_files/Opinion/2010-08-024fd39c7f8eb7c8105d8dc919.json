{"source": "The New York Times", "lead_paragraph": "Here's an exercise: Read Sam Anderson's profile of James Franco for New York Magazine. Then go back and read Andrew Corsello's 1996 profile of Mira Sorvino for GQ. Both are essays about highly-cerebral, possibly-overeducated celebrity actors whose peculiar personae are more interesting than any of the movies they've made. Both are the work of extremely skillful and engaging writers. But Anderson's profile is an exercise in rueful wonderment, whereas Corsello's profile is a brutal takedown. Franco's intellectual pretentions are celebrated and his eccentricities are smiled upon; Sorvino's intellectual ambitions are used against her and her eccentricities mercilessly mocked. Anderson goes out of his way to insist that Franco's academic work is legitimate; Corsello makes fun of Sorvino for talking about her honors thesis. Anderson takes a rueful attitude toward the gulf between Franco's ambitions and his actual body of work; Corsello has a good time making fun of \"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.\" And so forth.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "A tale of two profiles: Sorvino in 1996 and James Franco in 2010.", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "Ross Douthat", "main": "Sympathy For Mira Sorvino"}, "_id": "4fd39c7f8eb7c8105d8dc919", "web_url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/sympathy-for-mira-sorvino/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "DOUTHAT", "firstname": "Ross"}], "original": "By ROSS DOUTHAT"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 350, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "A tale of two profiles: Sorvino in 1996 and James Franco in 2010.", "pub_date": "2010-08-02T10:05:25Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Opinion"}
