Invoking a different political scientist, Kevin Drum suggested that \"about 70 percent of the seat changes\" this Tuesday are the result of forces beyond the Democrats' control, leaving just 30 percent of any conservative swing to be pinned on day-to-day politics and policy choices.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "name": "type_of_material", "value": "News"}], "multimedia": [], "snippet": "Do structural factors explain the Democrats' looming defeat?", "print_page": null, "blog": [], "headline": {"kicker": "Ross Douthat", "main": "Modeling the Midterms"}, "_id": "4fd39d928eb7c8105d8df255", "web_url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/modeling-the-midterms/", "slideshow_credits": null, "byline": {"person": [{"organization": "", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "DOUTHAT", "firstname": "Ross"}], "original": "By ROSS DOUTHAT"}, "news_desk": null, "word_count": 350, "document_type": "blogpost", "type_of_material": "Blog", "abstract": "Do structural factors explain the Democrats' looming defeat?", "pub_date": "2010-11-01T13:49:18Z", "subsection_name": null, "section_name": "Opinion"}
