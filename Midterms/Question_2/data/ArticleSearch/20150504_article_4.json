Born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, as part of the extended Brown- Howe clan, she spent years during the Depression in Woodland, NY, the Botchford family homestead that remained her favorite family gathering place and trout- fishing haunt. She graduated from Chatham Hall School and was a member of the class of 1942 at Vassar College, leaving in 1941 to marry Gardner Fordyce (\"Spider\") Gillespie, Jr., as war loomed. She raised her family in Rye, NY, and became an accomplished artist, painting landscapes and children's portraits and continuing her work until her final weeks. She was an active member of the Silvermine Artists Guild and later served on the Killingworth, CT, Wetlands Commission. For the last 15 years, and continuing after the death of her beloved Spider, she lived in Chester, CT. She is survived by her four children (Susan Howe Gillespie, Gardner Fordyce Gillespie, III (and his wife Stevie), Nancy Clift Gillespie de la Selle (and her husband Sebastien) and Douglas Brown Gillespie (and his wife Ellie), nine grandchildren (Jennifer Kapczynski, Nathaniel Gillespie, Amy Kapczynski, Clara Gillespie Ferraro, Elise de la Selle Jones, Evan Gillespie, Violette de la Selle, Jamie Gillespie and Augusta Gillespie), and 10 great grandchildren.
