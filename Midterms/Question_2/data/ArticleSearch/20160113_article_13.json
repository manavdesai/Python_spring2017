Present, M.D., a beloved physician who, in a five-decade career at Mount Sinai, was at the forefront of research into the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Dr. Present was the first researcher to show the effectiveness of an immunosuppressant, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), in fighting Crohn's disease. When Dr. Present published his results in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1980, it changed the lives of thousands of Crohn's patients. Later, he studied the use of cyclosporine for severe steroid- refractory ulcerative colitis, and demonstrated that it could help avoid or delay colectomies in many of these seriously ill patients. In a third breakthrough in the late 1990s, Dr. Present studied cA2, also known as infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody, and showed, in another seminal paper in the NEJM, that it could help close fistulas in Crohn's patients. Early in his career at Mount Sinai, he was mentored by Henry D. Janowitz, M.D., for whom the Division of Gastroenterology is named. Dr. Present was also a talented clinician who cared for thousands of patients over his career. Over a decade ago, he and his wife, Jane, established an endowed fellowship at Mount Sinai to train graduates from outside institutions to become experts in the care of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Dr. and Mrs. Present also maintained a foundation for clinical research of IBD. Upon his retirement from Mount Sinai in 2014, the foundation donated its principal in support of The Susan and Leonard Feinstein Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinical Center at Mount Sinai. We extend our deepest sympathies to Jane and their children, Douglas, Stephanie, and Tracy, at this difficult time. Peter W. May, Chairman, Boards of Trustees, Mount Sinai Health System Kenneth L.
