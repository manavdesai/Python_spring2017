Beloved by his wife of 32 years, Eileen Stegman Dispenzieri, his daughters, Elizabeth Mutlu of Bay Terrace, NY and Angela Dispenzieri of Rochester, MN, and his grandsons, Michael Mutlu and James Mutlu. Also survived by his ex-wife Francine Dispenzieri and many nieces and nephews. Born to Sicilian immigrant parents, Cataldo and Sebastiana, on August 2, 1929, he was raised in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with his six siblings: Frank, Josephine Lepani, Anthony, Charles, Angela Pumilia and Salvatore; all of whom preceded him in death. He earned his BA from Baruch College (1953) and his PhD in Psychology from New York University (1961). He lived a full life; a Professor of Psychology at Baruch College where he also served as Dean of Evening and Extension Division; a psychotherapist in private practice; and a consultant/lecturer in industrial/organizational psychology. In his private life, he enjoyed his family, music, fine art, and things of beauty. He lived for love, knowledge and compassion for others, and often said that there is no problem in life that could not be solved. His brand of knowledge, optimism, and story telling was a source of solace, hope and transformation for many. We will miss his presence but he will be with us as he touched us with his love and wisdom. There will be no funeral services at the decedent's request; a private memorial will be held in the spring.
