He was 90 years old. Born in Bronx, NY on November 13, 1924, LeRoy was the son of Aaron and Dorothy Rubin and brother to Justine Auerbach, who predeceased him. He was married for 63 years to Barbara Eydenberg Rubin who survives him. They have three children-Jim Rubin (Faye Weitzman), Jane Hoffman (Coley) and Patty Sacks (Douglas), 11 grandchildren (Alexis (Evan), Zac, Josh, Danny, Sophie, Hillary, Tim, Chris, Olivia, Elizabeth and Haley), one great-grandchild (Myles), one nephew and three nieces. Lee was the founder and owner of LeeBar Management Company. Leebar owns and manages a variety of residential, commercial, and industrial properties both in and around New York and in other parts of the country. Lee converted numerous prewar apartment buildings on the upper westside into cooperatives, and loved to tell stories of his great bargaining accomplishments with the tenants groups in these buildings. Lee loved the business and remained until his death a very savvy bargain seeker and indefatigable deal hunter. He was an active board member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and the President's Council at Weill Cornell Hospital. Lee was a long standing member and director of the Lotos Club. A hearty club participant, he served on the finance and arts committee. He was often found at state dinners, reading plays, and engaging with great interest in history book groups. Lee was known for a quick wit and irreverent sense of humor that often entertained and sometimes offended. He was an elegant man, a dapper dresser and loved conversation. Leroy graduated from Dewitt Clinton High School and the University of Pennsylvania. His college years were interrupted by his service in the US Army as a member of the 103rd Infantry Division in World War II. After basic training he was deployed to France but was soon captured by the Germans. He spent months in a POW camp in the Czech Republic. His wartime experiences - which influenced much of his adult life - were documented both by the Shoah foundation and the book, No Hero, No Coward, by George Davis. Above all, Lee cherished time with family, his adored wife, and their active life in the community of Stamford, Connecticut where he sat on school and museum boards. His quiet time was spent in the out of doors, on the ski slopes of Vermont, Colorado and Europe, fox hunting and horseback riding in Upper Westchester and with a great book. Lee remained to the end a patriarch and embracer of family time. He was an impulsive and persistent telephoner of his three children, their spouses and the 11 grandchildren. Lee, Dad, Grandpa, Great-gramps, Uncle Lee will be sorely missed but will live on in the family members he touched and deeply influenced. Rest well, Le Roi- our king! Our hearts are broken. The family will receive guests Monday and Tuesday from 4-8pm at 35 Sutton Place #9C.
