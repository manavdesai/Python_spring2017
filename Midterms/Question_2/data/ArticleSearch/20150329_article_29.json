Leaving behind the simplicity of country life, the girls are thrust into the dangerous and thrilling world of court life--and what began as a bid to help their family develops into a ruthless rivalry between Anne and Mary for the love of the King.  Initially, Mary wins King Henry's favor and becomes his mistress, bearing him two illegitimate children.  But Anne, clever, conniving and fearless, edges aside both her sister and Henry's wife, Queen Katherine of Aragon, in her relentless pursuit of the King.  Despite Mary's genuine feelings for Henry, her sister Anne has her sights set on the ultimate prize; Anne will not stop until she is Queen of England.  As the Boleyn girls battle for the love of a King--one driven by ambition, the other by true affection--England is torn apart.", "multimedia": [{"type": "image", "legacy": {"wide":
