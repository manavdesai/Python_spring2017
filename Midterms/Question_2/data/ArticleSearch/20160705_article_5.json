She was a female pioneer in the nursing profession for over 40 years before becoming involved in the funeral industry. She was instrumental in growing the company to what it has become today, one of the largest family owned and operating Jewish Funeral Homes in the country. Her dedication to her job, patients and family were second to none. She will always be remembered for her quick wit, great memory, class and generosity. She cared so very much about everyone and was truly interested in everything that her family and friends were involved with. She will be greatly missed and remembered every day by all who had the privilege to know her and love her. Rest in Peace.
