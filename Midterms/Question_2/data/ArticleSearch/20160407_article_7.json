Army Veteran of the Korean War. Co-founder with George Mourges of JG Melon, upper east side's famous saloon. Since opening its doors in 1972, this institution has welcomed, politicians, prime ministers, presidents, movie stars, artists and writers as well as the neighborhood crowd. Jack was a familiar figure around town with impeccable taste in all things. Jack had two passions in life: his wife of 33 years, to whom he often said, \"my job is to make you happy,\" and his golf game, about which he loved to brag that he could shoot his age, although he remarked it was getting easier as he got older. Jack's favorite time of the year was opening weekend of the golf season at Noyac Golf Club, Sag Harbor, NY, where he was a valued member since 1982. Known for his wit and generosity among family, friends, golf buddies and staff and patrons of his restaurants, genius storyteller and master of zingers, you always knew exactly where you stood with Jack. He will be missed. A memorial service will be held on Monday, April 11th at 11:30am, Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home (The Funeral Chapel) located at 1076 Madison Avenue in New York City, New York (81st St).

Born in Chicago on September 10, 1917, Paul was the only child of Elizabeth Bawden Wagner and Paul August Wagner. He earned a Bachelors Degree at the University of Chicago under the leadership of Robert Hutchins. Paul credited Hutchins with the principles and ideals that informed his own values and standards. Paul added a Master's Degree at Yale, and received an Honorary Doctorate from the Stetson University College of Law. Throughout his life his work focused on education and global communications in a pluralistic society. A Lieutenant Commander in the Navy during WWII, he was an education advisor at the Naval War College. After the war he taught at the University of Chicago and Columbia University. While a senior executive at Bell and Howell, he advocated the importance of using new technologies--audio and video--in education. At the age of 31 he was selected as the President of Rollins College in Florida, and was the youngest head of a college in the U.S. His mission: educate generalists-- male and female--who could love poetry and sports, math and science, and great books. He was the founding CEO of the Film Council of America--a Ford Foundation grantee. The organization supported the development of audiovisual educational tools, including documentary and educational films. Paul was a pioneer in the public relations profession. As a Senior Executive, he led the global education practice of Hill and Knowlton, the world's largest public relations organization. In the seventies, he founded his own public relations company--NPO Taskforce--to expand the work solely in the non-profit area. Upon his wife's retirement in 1999 as the Vice Chairman of The Estee Lauder Companies, they formed a pro bono group-- Nulli Secundus Associates--to aid clients from the non-profit world in the development of their strategies to be executed to success. They served many groups at no fee. Paul was a member of The Union League Club, The Yale Club, The Harvard Club, The Naval War College Foundation, and The University of Chicago Emeriti. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter Paula A. Wagner, his son Paul A. Wagner III, and his daughter-in-law Helga Maurer Wagner. His many friends all write that \"an extraordinary human being is gone.\" \"His smile lit the room. His laugh filled the world.\" Paul loved his home and his friends in Sag Harbor. The family suggests that memorial gifts be directed to The Paul A. Wagner Scholar's Study, and The Paul A. Wagner Children's Room at the John Jermain Memorial Library.
