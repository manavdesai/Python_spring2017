He lived in New York City for many years and then moved permanently to Litchfield in 2003. His parents were Olga Willoughby Ellis and Henry Clyde Ellis; his older sister, Patricia, predeceased him. For 48 years he was most happily married to Jane Bacon Ellis, who died in 2011. He is survived by loving daughters Clare Ellis of New York City and Kate Ellis Hobsbawm of London, England; son-in-law Andy Hobsbawm; grandchildren Milo and Eve Hobsbawm; and his wonderful partner, Karen Silk.

John.<br/><br/> Real Estate developer R. John Punnett died peacefully on Monday, June 6th at his home in Manhattan. He was 89 years old. Born in Zemun, Yugoslavia on February 8, 1927 to Tamara Gert and RAF pilot Schuyler Punnett, John and his sister Lydia were raised first in Greece, and later moving to Nantes, France where they lived during the German occupation. Being fluent in English, French, and Russian, he joined the RAF at age 17 and was stationed in Cairo and in Baghdad working in the Intelligence division. At the end of the war he was granted a full scholarship to attend the University of Cambridge, where he earned a BA in Russian literature. In 1956 he joined his sister in New York where he remained throughout his life. With a loan from his mother, in 1962 he began a career in real estate and founded Punnett Realty Company, eventually owning and managing up to 30 buildings largely centered in the Yorkville neighborhood. Always dressed in his trademark English suits, John was extremely respected in his field and known by everyone as a true gentleman. This was reflected by the fact that most of his employees had been with him for several decades. His work ethic was inspiring to many. Rarely taking a day off, he continued to go to his office until recently. There were few things John enjoyed more than spending time with his numerous friends and growing family and he described his six grandchildren as his \"brood\". He was most at peace in his Southampton home, where he maintained a residence for over four decades. He was predeceased by his sister Lydia Wasserman and is survived by his wife Carol, his son Anthony, daughters Dominique, Daniela, and his grandchildren Tatiana, Alexi, Kayden, Lucas, Olivia, and Alexandra. John will be missed for his generosity, his dry sense of humor, his keen intellect, and his love of the arts. He will be remembered by his family as a great father, teacher, and wonderful provider. Funeral services will be held at Brockett Funeral Home in Southampton on Saturday, June 11th, beginning at 10am. Memorial donations to the R. John Punnett Foundation, 107 Lee Ave., Southampton, NY 11968 would be appreciated.<br><br>\n ", "multimedia": [], "news_desk": "Classified"}, {"web_url": "http://www.legacy.com/Link.asp?I=LS000180264805", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  SPATZ, ILSE "}, "snippet": "SPATZ--Ilse, born January 29, 1930, died June 5, 2016.

Armstrong, as well as many loving nieces and nephews. The only child of Edward Francis and Mary (Daly) Fitzgerald, she grew up in the Bronx, attending Ursuline Academy, Maplehurst Academy and Manhattanville College, on an academic scholarship, graduating in 1946. As a senior, she won Vogue Magazine's Prix de Paris essay contest and spent the next year working for the magazine in Manhattan. She married Jack Brennan in 1948 at St. Francis de Sales Church in Rockaway, NY, and they had 10 children. In 1957, the family moved to Manhasset, where for nearly six decades she was a deeply committed community volunteer and activist involved in, most notably, St. Mary's of Manhasset Parish. She served as a Eucharistic Minister, Lector, Blood Bank Coordinator, and member of the Parish Council. She also worked with the Manhattanville Alumni Association, the AAUW and the League of Women Voters. While raising her children, she earned a Masters of Arts in Liberal Studies at Manhattanville. After all 10 children finished college, she resumed her journalism career beginning at the Port Washington News, and later as editor of the Manhasset Press. Eventually, she was editing eight papers for Anton Community Newspapers. The Manhasset Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce honored her. In Manhasset, Eileen and Jack made many beloved friends and the family knows they grieve with us now. A wake will be held at Fairchild and Sons in Manhasset on Friday; 2 to 5pm and 7 to 9pm.

For the last 53 years, he also spent as much time as he could at his farm in Washington County, NY. Lester was born February 8, 1918 to David and Helen Migdal in Brooklyn, NY. He attended public schools in Brooklyn and graduated from City College of New York, where he studied philosophy, and from Harvard Law School. His marriage of 28 years to Ellen Marcus MigdaI ended on her death in August, 1970. His second marriage of 38 years to Eleanor Jackson Burt Migdal ended on her death in March, 2013. He is survived by five children: Joanna Migdal, Eliza Migdal, David Migdal, Kaethe Burt-O'Dea and Sarah Burt, twelve grandchildren, nine great- grandchildren, and his brother, Dr. Walter Migdal. Lester served during the Second World War as a captain in the Army combat engineers. After the Battle of the Bulge, he commanded a company that under heavy fire built one of the pontoon bridges across the Rhine River which the allied armies crossed to defeat Germany; Lester loved the law, which he practiced in New York City for over 50 years, at his own firm. His cases ranged from the defense of a victim of the McCarthy witch hunts to the representation of extended families, in all legal matters from marriage and children to death and taxes, to more public matters argued and won at the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of his clients became his close friends. Lester collected thousands of books. With insatiable curiosity and a lifetime of insomnia, he read them all. He was particularly interested in literature, criticism and poetry. In his later years, intensely missing both his wives he found special solace in poetry. Lester valued his close relationship with his family and friends. A few nights before he died he played poker with a group of friends in a game that had lasted forty years. Lester will be remembered for his intelligence, wit, fearlessness, and gentility. He maintained his talent for respectful kindness, and the easy and intense connections with others which flowed from that, until the day he died.
